### Rasperry Pi Reaction Time Game
- Uses the new **Rasperry Pi Pico W**, code written in **Thonny** in **Python**
- Uses an **LED** to prompt players, and one **LED** each to display scores 
- First player to press the **button** gets a point
- Points are displayed and the game cycles again
- Score resets when one player reaches five points
- More info displayed on the **Serial Monitor** (terminal-like window)

### The idea behind the project:
Pick a problem or need and use Design Thinking to propose, develop and prototype an embedded design to solve that problem using an Arduino and using its associated techniques.
Required elements:
It must exhibit interaction by:
- Using at least two digital or analog inputs, using a least one that is not a button or switch
- Using at least two digital outputs, using at least one that is not an LED.
